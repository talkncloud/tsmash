What the heck is this and why am I here?

Well, this is a very simple helper to autofill the **AWS** input boxes when you go to delete an item. If you delete and S3 bucket you'll need to populate the input box with the bucket name, if you delete a DynamoDB table you'll need to input "delete" etc. It varies from resource to resource.

## How do I get

It's a simple browser extension with support for Chrome and FireFox, simply use the addons or extension to search for tsmash

### FireFox
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tsmash-for-aws/

### Chrome
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tsmash/domdhiedcmknajdmhcfbplcahpmkmnff?hl=en-GB

## Options

Being as simple as it is there are very few options, actually one. It takes a list of account id's that you want to exclude. Some people may want to keep the added protection of inputing resource names in production for example. Adding your account id in the options field will make sure that still happens.
